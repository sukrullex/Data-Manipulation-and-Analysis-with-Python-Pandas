# Data-Manipulation-and-Analysis-with-Python-Pandas
During my graduation project, I have dealt with a lot of Data Pre-processing stuff without using any libraries. I was using if statements and loops. It literally killed me. After I started to learn Pandas, I decided to write this repository to help students and beginners to get start with it. I will do my best to introduce you with Pandasâ€™ some of the most useful capabilities. 
We will focus on

-Importing the data-

-Displaying first and last n rows-
-Reading files with specific columns-
-Displaying mean, max, min, 1st and 3rd quartile, counts for each column-
-Displaying the data types of each column-
-Sorting numeric and categorical variables-
-Counting occurences-
-Counting unique values-
-Changing data type-
-Filtering with one or more condition with AND and OR-
-Finding null values-
-How to deal with missing values-
-Dropping one or more column-
-Filling missing values-
